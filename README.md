## About
Murder in Olympus is web based game. Its a social deduction group game similar to Among Us or Mafia. Players secretly take on roles and try to figure out who is the werewolf before the werewolves kill everyone else

There are 2 main teams: the Olympians and the werewolves. Every round, a werewolf can wake up at night and select someone to eliminate. The olympians would wake up at the end of the round and try to deduce who the werewolves are. 
In order to figure out who the werewolf is, players can talk to each other through a text chat in order to come up with strategies and win the game. Werewolves would also have a private text chat to allow them to come up with their own strategies as well.

Players would then vote who they think is the werewolf using a voting system. The narrator would then reveal if the person who was eliminated was truly a werewolf or an Olympian.
